The Ghoderao-Dalvi-Narayan (GDN) EOS was developed at ICT Mumbai.
<br>The GDN EOS excels in predicting the thermodynamic properties of 334 pure compounds, including saturated vapor pressure, liquid density, and heat capacities. It requires a limited set of parameters—critical temperature, critical pressure, Pitzer's acentric factor, critical compressibility factor, and two parameters for the alpha function—making it user-friendly. The EOS demonstrates high accuracy, particularly in predicting saturated liquid density, outperforming other models such as GDN1, Modified Peng-Robinson (MPR), and Patel-Teja (PT). Furthermore, its temperature-dependent covolume parameter  effectively addresses thermodynamic inconsistencies at extreme conditions, enhancing its reliability. <br>
<br>Comprehensive Property Prediction: Accurately predicts multiple thermodynamic properties. 
<br>Minimal Parameter Requirement: Requires only critical and acentric factor data. - High Accuracy: Superior performance in saturated liquid density predictions.

This is useful for several applications:<br>
<br>Chemical equilibrium: Understanding the behavior of mixture components during reactions in various phases.
<br>Separation processes: These processes, like liquid-liquid extraction, crystallization, humidification, and distillation, often occur under phase equilibrium conditions.
<br>In general, the property  represents any Extensive properties like , , ,  et al and the total property M will depend upon factor like Temperature, pressure etc.Where:<br>

When temperature and pressure are held constant, the chemical potential  is equivalent to the partial molar Gibbs free energy for  component:<br><br>This relationship is fundamental to understanding chemical equilibrium and phase equilibrium. It acts as the driving force behind diffusion, phase changes, and reactions, linking thermodynamics with the behavior of individual components in a mixture.<br>
<br>In phase equilibrium, the chemical potential of a component must be the same in all phases.
<br>In chemical reactions, equilibrium is achieved when the chemical potentials of reactants and products are balanced.<br>
Chemical potential plays a key role in determining the direction and extent of reactions and phase transformations.<br>

Similarly,<br><br>However the the case is different when it comes to Entropy.<br>
<br>Nature of Measurement: The entropy change  is not zero because gases mix, increasing the overall disorder of the system, while internal energy (), enthalpy (), and volume () represent energy and spatial characteristics.
<br>Response to Mixing:Initially, each gas is at 1 atm; after mixing, the total pressure remains the same, introducing partial pressures for each gas.
<br>Spontaneity of Processes: This mixing is a spontaneous process that enhances chaos, leading to a greater number of accessible microstates.
<br>Additivity: Entropy is additive for independent subsystems, leading to a total entropy that differs conceptually from the treatment of energy or volume in mixtures.
